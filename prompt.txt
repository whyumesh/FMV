now i have updated the DVL file with only 2 columns "Customer Code", "Account: Email" and removed all the duplicates.

below is the list of columns need to be used.

    "Start time", "HCP Email",
    "Clinical Experience: i.e. Time Spent with Patients?",
    "Leadership position(s) in a Professional or Scientific Society and/or leadership position(s) in Hospital or other Patient Care Settings (e.g. Department Head or Chief, Medical Director, Lab Direct...",
    "Geographic influence as a Key Opinion Leader.",
    "Highest Academic Position Held in past 10 years",
    "Educational Qualification", "Additional Educational Level",
    "Specialty / Super Specialty",
    "Years of experience in the Specialty / Super Specialty?",
    "Research Experience (e.g., industry-sponsored research, investigator-initiated research, other research) in past 10 years",
    "Publication experience in the past 10 years",
    "Speaking experience (professional, academic, scientific, or media experience) in the past 10 years."

first take one email from "Account: Email" search it in "HCP Email" if found copy the corresponding information from the above given columns. and insert them into the 
FMV_Calculator file. you have the file so insert the values at appropriate place. if the email is not found in "HCP Email" create a new file of it. be prepared for every scenario.
there might be multiple entries with same email in "HCP Email", at that time see the date & time in "Start time" column and use the latest entry it is in m/d/yyyy h:mm format.
the main goal is to not manually insert Dr values in FMV_Calculator to calculate their Tier and score. so don't touch the score and tier columns i have added VLOOKUP to those columns cells 
so as any Dr. details are added automatically their score and tier is calculated.

NOTE :- THERE IS NO SCOPE OF ERROR.
